# TriDeepRec Model

## Overview
TriDeepRec is an innovative deep learning-based recommendation system designed to leverage the strengths of three neural network architectures. This approach aims to enhance prediction accuracy and tackle common recommender system challenges such as the cold start problem and data sparsity.

## Features
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines collaborative filtering with deep neural networks to improve recommendation quality.
- **Cold Start Solution**: Utilizes content-based features to provide recommendations for new items or users.
- **Scalable**: Efficiently handles large datasets, suitable for enterprise-level applications.

## Prerequisites
To run the TriDeepRec model, you need the following:
- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Surprise (for SVD components)

## Installation
Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
